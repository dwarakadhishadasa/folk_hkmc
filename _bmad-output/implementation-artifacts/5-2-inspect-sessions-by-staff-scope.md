# Story 5.2: Inspect Sessions By Staff Scope

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Freshly generated from `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` on 2026-06-13T00:44:20+05:30. -->

## Story

As a Preacher or Admin,
I want to inspect only the Sessions I am allowed to operate,
so that Session management stays aligned with Program ownership and location rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given an active Admin requests the Sessions page or `GET /api/sessions`
   When Sessions are loaded
   Then the response includes all operational Sessions needed for Admin management in the active Program
   And no Sessions from the other Program are returned.
2. Given an active Preacher requests Sessions
   When Sessions are loaded
   Then the response includes owned Sessions or allowed-location Sessions according to the approved scope rule
   And unrelated Sessions are not returned.
3. Given an active Volunteer requests Sessions
   When server authorization runs
   Then access is denied
   And no Session records are returned to the browser.
4. Given Airtable records contain missing optional fields
   When Sessions are mapped to API payloads
   Then the route returns stable typed JSON with safe null or empty values
   And the client does not crash.
5. Given a Session has an attendance URL and open/close state
   When the Sessions UI renders it
   Then staff can see whether attendance is currently open
   And the shown link matches server enforcement.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Re-read the source story and dependent decisions before implementation (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Confirm unresolved DD gates are resolved or explicitly waived where this story depends on them.
  - [ ] Identify every existing route/component/helper listed below that will be updated and read it before editing.
- [ ] Implement `Inspect Sessions By Staff Scope` according to the acceptance criteria (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Keep Program context explicit at every server boundary.
  - [ ] Reuse existing helpers, contracts, UI primitives, and route patterns before adding new abstractions.
  - [ ] Preserve current FOLK behavior unless the acceptance criteria explicitly require a change.
- [ ] Validate privileged route authorization server-side and keep user-facing failures actionable but non-sensitive.
- [ ] Verify the implementation
  - [ ] Run required lint/type checks for product code changes.
  - [ ] Record manual smoke-test notes for affected staff/public flows.

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

- Epic: Session Operations And Live Attendance.
- Epic goal: Preachers and Admins can create scoped Sessions, generate attendance links/QR codes, and monitor live attendance with duplicate-safe dashboard refresh.
- Story source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` section `Story 5.2: Inspect Sessions By Staff Scope`.

### Non-Negotiable Guardrails

- Resolve Program context before reading or writing Program-scoped data; never trust a client-supplied Program ID for cross-program access.
- Keep Airtable REST access, Airtable credentials, Supabase service-role operations, and authz server helpers out of client components.
- Preserve current FOLK parity contracts for registration, attendance, session-backed registration, duplicate handling, mobile normalization, sessions, dashboard polling, invite flows, manage handoff, and service-worker queueing unless this story explicitly changes them.
- Use stable Program IDs `folk` and `gita-life`; API payloads use `camelCase`, while Supabase tables and columns use `snake_case`.
- Keep errors safe and actionable. API error responses should use `{ error: string, code?: string }` and must not expose Airtable API details, Supabase service-role errors, tokens, or OTP values.
- Reuse existing `components/ui/*`, feature components, `lib/utils.ts`, Supabase helpers, and Airtable helper patterns before adding new primitives or route contracts.

### Story-Specific Notes

- Session links must be generated from the active Program App `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and must align with server-side attendance window enforcement.
- Before implementation, check lower-numbered stories in Epic 5 and any completed readiness gates for decisions this story depends on.

### Files / Areas To Read Before Editing

- `app/sessions/page.tsx`
- `components/sessions-manager.tsx`
- `app/api/sessions/route.ts`
- `lib/authz.ts`
- `lib/airtable.ts`

### Architecture Compliance

- Target architecture is an adapted in-place Turborepo workspace with `apps/folk`, `apps/gita-life`, and shared packages for `ui`, `program-config`, `data-contracts`, `authz`, and `airtable`.
- Each Program App should deploy as its own Vercel Project with app-specific `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, Supabase redirect URLs, Airtable Base/table env vars, and management interface configuration.
- Shared staff identity lives in one Supabase project; authorization is Program-scoped through memberships, role cache, Airtable identity mapping, sync state, and audit data.
- Airtable remains the operational source for Contacts, Attendance, Sessions, Users/Staff, Locations, and management interfaces. Supabase is the runtime authorization mirror, not the primary store for operational records.
- Admin and role-changing actions fail closed when sync state is stale, unknown, or unresolved by policy.

### Testing Requirements

- Run `pnpm lint` for product code changes.
- Run `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` because this repo can ignore TypeScript errors during Next builds.
- For UI work, manually verify the affected workflow at 360px width, keyboard navigation, focus visibility, labels, and status messaging.
- For auth/server-route work, smoke-test authorized, unauthorized, wrong-role, inactive/revoked, and stale-sync paths as applicable.
- For Airtable/PWA work, smoke-test success, duplicate/already-existing, validation failure, offline/queued, replay, and safe error states as applicable.

### Project Structure Notes

- Current workspace still contains a top-level brownfield app plus a nascent `apps/gita-life` boundary; verify current file locations before moving or importing code.
- Keep app-local pages and Program-specific copy/assets in the relevant app boundary once the split exists.
- Shared contracts, Program config, authz helpers, Airtable adapters, and UI primitives should move into packages only when the story owns or requires that extraction.
